# Time Reversal
 A generic Unity project integrating the mechanism of Time Reversal!

### Project Description
 This unity project contains a basic world where you can reverse time using spacebar. Time reversal affects all bodies except your own self. Explore the world to find some boxes, and blow them up using left click. However, there is a surprise, after which you will need to reverse time to make everything tidy again!
